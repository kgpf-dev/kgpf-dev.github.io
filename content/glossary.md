### Community Facilities Districts

::card
Created to provide an alternate method of financing needed for public improvements and services.
Taxes are secured by a lien on CFD properties, and are collected on an annual basis.

The Mello-Roos Act allow counties, cities, school districts, joint powers authority and other
special districts to establish *Community Facilities Districts* (CFD), with which they can finance
certain public improvements and services.

CFDs can be attractive financing alternatives for public agencies and developers in rapidly growing
communities with large, undeveloped areas for many of the following reasons:

-  Election by either registered voters or landowners, if less than 12 registered voters live within
   a proposed CFD boundary, the formation is determined by a supermajority landowner vote (one vote
   per acre or portion of an acre). If more than 12 registered voters, the election is a registered
   voter election. 
-  Super majority is required for passage of CFD. 
-  Ballots may be mailed. 
-  The Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982 requires a standard of <q>reasonableness</q>
   (excepting ad valorem) in the determination of which properties can be included within a CFD,
   instead of the more stringent requirement of direct and special benefit. 
-  CFD boundaries can be expanded for phased developments through future annexations. 
-  CFD tax rates and methodologies put forward in the Rate and Method of Apportionment, may include
   the option to allow for prepayments and exemptions, as well as the option to place differential
   tax rates on properties the based on square footage and land use. 
-  Public agencies have the discretion to use Mello-Roos taxes to finance public improvements and
   services on a <q>pay-as-you-go</q> basis, or issue bonds and pledge tax proceeds towards
   servicing debt. 
-  CFDs may pay for many services.

*Assessment Districts* (AD) have been in existence since the early 1900s and are an alternative
method of financing certain public improvements; however, unlike Community Facilities Districts,
only special (as opposed to general) benefit may be assessed.

Assessment districts are structured as such:

::div{.sm:grid .sm:grid-cols-2 .sm:gap-4}
:::div
- Only special benefit can be assessed
- Limited flexibility in providing exemptions
- Lien placed on property
- Property owner ballot protest procedure:
  - Ballot weighted on assessment amount
  - Mailed ballots
  - Simple majority (based on weighted assessment) required to form AD
:::
:::div
- Requires an <q>engineer’s report</q> that:
  - Describes boundaries of the AD
  - Determines special benefit
  - Defines assessment amounts
  - Defines method of apportioning assessments

### Landscaping and Lighting Districts

A *Landscaping and Lighting District* (LLD) is a form of benefit assessment in which only special
benefit may be assessed, and are commonly used by local governments to finance approved uses
including:

- The installation and maintenance of street lighting
- Street landscaping
- Street traffic signals/lights
- Parks, trees and sidewalk repair
- Recreational improvements, including playground courts and equipment, public restrooms, and
  fountains and statues.

LLDs are formed pursuant to the Landscaping and Lighting Act of 1972, Parts of Division 15 of the
California Streets and Highways Code, and Article XIIID of the California Constitution.
