Koppel & Gruber Public Finance has been specializing in financial consulting to public agencies in
California since 2004. The founding partners of the firm, Scott Koppel and Lyn Gruber, began their
careers in municipal financial consulting in 1992 and 1994 respectively.

We are privately held and
our greatest concern is the satisfaction of our clients and their constituents and not shareholders.
It is our practice to respect the culture and practices of each agency client and act as an addition
to your staff.
