Proposition 218?
----------------

California voters passed Proposition 218 (Right to Vote on Taxes Act) in November of 1996 which
requires voters to approve new charges and increases on existing charges. Therefore, public agencies
which need to increase special assessments and/or charges to remain fiscally sound must comply with
the noticing requirements (or voting requirements) of Proposition 218.

Furthermore, in July 2006, the California Supreme Court decided the Bighorn-Desert View Water Agency
v. Beringson and held that service fees available to the public at large (such as water, sewer and
trash) cannot be increased without complying with the noticing requirements of Proposition 218.
