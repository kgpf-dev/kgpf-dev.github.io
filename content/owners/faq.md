What is K&G Public Finance's role?
----------------------------------

K&G Public Finance specialize in financial consulting to public agencies, and one of the services we
provide is the Annual Administration of Special Districts. Such districts include [Community
Facilities Districts](#community-facilities-district) (commonly referred to as Mello-Roos
districts), [Landscaping and Lighting Districts](#landscaping-and-lighting-district), and
1913 Act [Assessment Districts](#assessment-district), as well as Benefit Fee Assessments
and other fixed charge special assessments.

Annual Administration refers to the process of calculating the [special
taxes/charges](#special-charge) or fees for these various Special Districts and placing
these on the County Tax Roll to be included on the Annual Tax Bill.

If you see our toll-free phone number next to a line item on your property tax bill

---

Proposition 218?
----------------

California voters passed Proposition 218 (Right to Vote on Taxes Act) in November of 1996 which
requires voters to approve new charges and increases on existing charges. Therefore, public agencies
which need to increase special assessments and/or charges to remain fiscally sound must comply with
the noticing requirements (or voting requirements) of Proposition 218.

Furthermore, in July 2006, the California Supreme Court decided the Bighorn-Desert View Water Agency
v. Beringson and held that service fees available to the public at large (such as water, sewer and
trash) cannot be increased without complying with the noticing requirements of Proposition 218.
