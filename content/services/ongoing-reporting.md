CDIAC debt issuance reporting
-----------------------------

California government code prescribes that certain information be reported to the *California Debt
and Investment Advisory Commission* (CDIAC) annually regarding public debt issued by state and local
government agencies, and mandates additional reporting requirements specific to debt issuances for
Mello-Roos Community Facilities Districts. Furthermore, throughout the year, agencies must report
any draws upon the reserve fund to service debt and/or interest payments, and defaults on debt
service payments. K&G Public Finance can offer years of experience in post-issuance compliance, and
has presented at annual workshops hosted by CDIAC.

Continuing disclosure
---------------------

Most issuers of municipal bonds must disclose and provide information which will enable
investors to make informed decisions regarding their investments. As a continuing disclosure agent,
K&G Public Finance, will provide the necessary services to satisfy the requirements of disclosure
obligations and as stipulated in the Continuing Disclosure Agreement and other related bond
documents.

Rule 15c2-12 was adopted by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to increase reliability of
disseminated information, several amendments were made which now include continuing disclosure
(disclosure and operating information filed annually) and disclosure of material events.

Special tax and bond accountability reporting
---------------------------------------------

The Local Agency Special Tax and Bond Accountability Act (Accountability Act) was enacted by
California State Legislature through Senate Bill 165 to provide accountability measures for any
local special tax and/or bond measure subject to voter approval on or after January 1, 2001.

According to the requirements of the Accountability Act (Sections 50075.1 and 53410 of the
Government Code of the State of California), an annual report must be filed by the local agency
levying a special tax and/or issuing a bond measure on or before each January 1, commencing January
1, 2001 and shall contain a description of the following:

1. The amount of funds collected and expended to fund authorized facilities and services in the
   previous fiscal year.

2. The status of any project required or authorized to be funded by the special tax and/or bond
   measure.

K&G Public Finance prepares the necessary reporting in compliance with the Accountability Act.
