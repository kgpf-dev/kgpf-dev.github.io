Geographic information systems
==============================

---

One of the most signification innovations in government in recent years have been the adoption of
geospatial technologies ubiquitously referred to as *geographic information systems* (GIS). The
standardization of coordinate systems has enabled the synthesis and sharing of spatial information
with a higher degree of efficiency and accuracy than was possible previously. At K&G Public Finance,
we leverage geospatial technologies to take our clients to the next level of public administration.

K&G Public Finance can provide a variety of products and services to fit client needs, including
custom analyses and maps with spatial data, district boundary maps, formation and annexation maps
(see [special district formation](/services/special-districts#special-district-formation) for more
detail).

How we use GIS

</div>

### Custom maps

K&G Public Finance has also worked with clients to produce custom maps. Recent examples include:

- Recent permit activity
- Development and exemption status
- Historical boundaries
- Annexation areas

### Special district tax administration

We maintain spatial databases of parcels for special districts we administer. Discrepancies in
jurisdictional parcel records are a common source of inaccuracies in the calculation of special
charges, which is why K&G Public Finance inspects parcel information at least once every year,
consolidating information from multiple sources and agencies.

GIS technologies enable rapid year-over-year checks for changes in parcels, land use, and
development, as well as verification of development inclusion within special district boundaries.

### Student generation rate analyses

In the process of determining the number of new students within a school district area that are
expected to be generated from future residential development, the relevant statutes for School Fee
Justification Studies and School Facilities Needs Analyses require that the projection of students
be based on the historical student generation rates of residential units constructed.

Spatial matching of current student enrollment address data to school district property
characteristic information can provide the best evidence for student generation rate determination.
