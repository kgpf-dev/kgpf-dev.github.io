CDIAC debt issuance reporting
-----------------------------

California government code prescribes that certain information be reported to the California Debt
and Investment Advisory Commission (CDIAC) annually regarding public debt issued by state and local
government agencies, and mandates additional reporting requirements specific to debt issuances for
Mello-Roos Community Facilities Districts.

Furthermore, agencies throughout the year must report any draws upon the reserve fund in order to
service debt and/or interest payments, and especially any defaults on payments.

KGPF can offer years of experience in post-issuance compliance, and has presented at annual
workshops hosted by CDIAC.

Continuing Disclosure
---------------------

Most issuers of municipal bonds must disclose and provide information which will enable
investors to make informed decisions regarding their investments.

Since the adoption of Rule 15c2-12 by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to increase
reliability of disseminated information, several amendments have been made which now include
continuing disclosure (disclosure and operating information filed annually) and the disclosure of
material events.

As a continuing disclosure agent KGPF will provide the necessary services to satisfy the
requirements of disclosure obligations and as stipulated in the Continuing Disclosure Agreement and
other related bond documents.

Special Tax and Bond Accountability Reporting
---------------------------------------------

The Local Agency Special Tax and Bond Accountability Act (Accountability Act) was enacted by
California State Legislature through Senate Bill 165 to provide accountability measures for any
local special tax and/or bond measure subject to voter approval on or after January 1, 2001.

According to the requirements of the Accountability Act (Sections 50075.1 and 53410 of the
Government Code of the State of California), an annual report must be filed by the local agency
levying a special tax and/or issuing a bond measure on or before each January 1, commencing January
1, 2001 and shall contain a description of the following:

1. The amount of funds collected and expended to fund authorized facilities and services in the
   previous fiscal year.

2. The status of any project required or authorized to be funded by the special tax and/or bond
   measure.

KGPF prepares the necessary reporting in compliance with the Accountability Act.
